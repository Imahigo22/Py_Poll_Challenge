##Overview##

I've been trying to get some data on the voter turnout in the three counties: Jefferson, Denver, and Araphoe.  The idea is that I run an analysis by getting the voter turnout by county and see which candidate won the election. The idea is to also see how many people voted.

###Analysis###
      
      .We had exactly 369,711 ballots cast in this analysis sheet.
      .And I've noticed that Denver is the largest county with the most voters.  It outshines both Jefferson and Araphoe by a landslide.
      .In fact, Denver had exactly 306,055 voters compared to the smaller counties only consisting of less than 40,00 voters.
      .Among the 369,711 votes, the candidate Diana DeGette also won by a landslide.  With exactly 272,892 voters, this consisted exactly 73.8% of all voters.
       Coming in second place, was Charles Casper Stockham, receiving 85,213 voters and only consisted of 23% of all voters.  Finally, we have Raymond Anthony Doane, 
       who unfortunately only had 11,606 voters and only had consisted of only 3.1% of all voters.
        
###Conclusion###

This script can be quite useful with calculating ballots and determining the winner of an election based on the popular votes.  One way it can be modified is by adding a column based on the political party voted and it can be used to see which regions lean a certain way. That way, the person running for office knows where exactly to go in order to promote their election campaign.  For instance, this script can be used to see that Davidson County, Wilson Conty, and Sumner County all lean slightly towards the Democratic party.  A Democrat will be able to see that they should focus their resources on promoting their election in that area of the state.  Another way is that it can also be used to see the population and voter turnout.  The findings can be used to see which highly populated areas of a state should be aimed at in order to promote one's election campaign.  Such as, trying to promote your campaign in El Paso, Texas, instead of somewhere remote in Texas.
